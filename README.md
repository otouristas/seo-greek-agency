-----------------------
  SEO READ ME 

 1. Implement Canonical URLs
Use the next/head component to add canonical tags to your pages. For dynamic pages, you can compute the canonical URL dynamically.

javascript
Copy
Edit
import Head from 'next/head';
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';

const SEO = ({ title, description, canonical }) => {
  const router = useRouter();
  const canonicalURL = canonical || `https://kasiotisg.com${router.asPath.split('?')[0]}`;

  return (
    <Head>
      <title>{title}</title>
      <meta name="description" content={description} />
      <link rel="canonical" href={canonicalURL} />
    </Head>
  );
};

export default SEO;
Usage in a Page Component:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import SEO from '../components/SEO';


2. Dynamic Canonical URLs for Dynamic Routes
For pages like /blog/[slug], dynamically set the canonical URL:

javascript
Copy
Edit
import { useRouter } from 'next/router';
import Head from 'next/head';

export default function BlogPost({ post }) {
  const router = useRouter();

  const canonicalURL = `https://kasiotisg.com${router.asPath.split('?')[0]}`;

  return (
    <>
      <Head>
        <title>{post.title}</title>
        <meta name="description" content={post.description} />
        <link rel="canonical" href={canonicalURL} />
      </Head>
      <h1>{post.title}</h1>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </>
  );
}
3. Use the Next.js next-sitemap Package
Automate sitemap and robots.txt generation with the next-sitemap package.

Install next-sitemap:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm install next-sitemap
Add Configuration:

Create a next-sitemap.config.js file in the root of your project:

javascript
Copy
Edit
module.exports = {
  siteUrl: 'https://kasiotisg.com',
  generateRobotsTxt: true, // (optional)
  exclude: ['/admin/*'], // Exclude specific paths if needed
};
Add to package.json:

json
Copy
Edit
"scripts": {
  "postbuild": "next-sitemap"
}
Run After Build:

bash
Copy
Edit
npm run build && npm run postbuild
4. Optimize Meta Tags
Always add the required meta tags for better SEO.

javascript
Copy
Edit
<Head>
  <title>Page Title</title>
  <meta name="description" content="Description of the page" />
  <meta name="robots" content="index, follow" />
  <meta property="og:title" content="Open Graph Title" />
  <meta property="og:description" content="Open Graph Description" />
  <meta property="og:url" content="https://kasiotisg.com/current-page" />
  <meta property="og:type" content="website" />
</Head>
5. Fix Canonical Issues
Double-check canonical URL usage by testing your pages with Google Search Console or SEO tools like Screaming Frog. Use the Inspect URL tool to see how Google interprets your pages.

6. Use getStaticProps or getServerSideProps for Metadata
For SEO-driven content, dynamically fetch metadata during build or request time.

javascript
Copy
Edit
export async function getStaticProps() {
  const post = await fetch('https://api.example.com/post/123').then((res) => res.json());
  return {
    props: {
      post,
    },
  };
}
7. Performance Optimizations
Lazy Load Images: Use the Next.js <Image> component for optimized image loading.
Caching and Compression: Ensure your hosting supports caching and Gzip compression.
Check Core Web Vitals: Use Google Lighthouse to optimize metrics like LCP, FID, and CLS.
